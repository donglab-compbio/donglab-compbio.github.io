            <h3>Epigenetics in Cancer</h3>
            <p>We have undertaken a comprehensive characterization of the functional roles played by EWSR1 fusion transcription factors in mediating long-distance chromatin interactions and regulating gene expression in the context of Ewing Sarcoma and Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumors. Furthermore, our investigations have revealed that EWS-FLI1 can promote oncogenesis by orchestrating the activity of other transcription factors, such as NFIB, through its intrinsically disordered regions.

            <h3>Single Cell and Spatial Transcriptomics</h3>
            <p>I have been dedicated to the development of GiniClust3, a powerful tool designed for large-scale single-cell datasets to identify rare cell clusters. Additionally, I have also developed SpatialDWLS, a highly accurate tool tailored for cell type decomposition in lower-resolution spatial transcriptomic datasets.
